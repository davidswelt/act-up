ACT-UP

An ACT-R toolkit library

This library allows its users to experiment with the ACT-R theory (Anderson 2007) and prototype cognitive models.  
It is based on Common Lisp, providing a Lisp API to functions of Declarative Memory, Procedural Memory and more.
It is light-weight, scalable and fast.
