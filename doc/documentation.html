Overview</A>
</H1>

<P>
ACT-UP is a cognitive modeling library that allows modelers to specify their model's functionality in Common Lisp.  Whenever a cognitive explanation in a particular part of the model is sought, the modeler uses the library to provide characteristics of 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>explicit, declarative learning and cue- and similarity-based
  retrieval, and
</LI>
<LI>procedural skill acquisition [not yet available]
</LI>
</UL>
following the ACT-R 6 theory.

<P>
As in the ACT-R 6 implementation, modelers are free to adhere more or less to the theoretical limitations.  However, ACT-UP's design encourages modelers to underspecify portions of the model's functionality that do not contribute to the model's explanations and predictions of human performance.  

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000">
How do I...</A>
</H1>

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020010">
... load the library?</A>
</H4>

<p>
Just load the file <tt>load-act-up.lisp</tt>:

The easiest way is to store the ACT-UP directory somewhere on your
hard drive and then hard-code the path:

<P class="code"> 
(load <span class="string">"/Users/me/modeling/ACT-UP/load-act-up.lisp"</span>)<br>
</p>

Windows users, beware: backslashes need to be doubled in Lisp strings;
forward slashes should work fine.
<p>
A more sophisticated solution uses a path relative to the model file.
Assuming our model file is <tt>ACT-UP/tutorials/model.lisp</tt>, do this:
<P class="code"> 
(load (concatenate 'string (directory-namestring *load-truename*) <span class="string">"../load-act-up.lisp"</span>))<br>
</p>
<p>
Here, we adjust its path so
that it is relative to the current file (rather than the directory that
happens to be current when Lisp is started or when the model file is loaded).

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020020">
... define a chunk type?</A>
</H4>

<P>

Unlike ACT-R, ACT-UP is not normally strongly typed.
All slot names are declared initially, but ACT-UP does not distinguish chunk types within a type hierarchy.
Chunk types are lisp structure types that inherit from the type <a href="ACT-UP.html#actup-chunk">actup-chunk</a>.  This type exists once the `define-slots' macro is called:

<P class="code"> (<span class="keyword">define-slots</span> name dampen success)<br></p>


If you do want to define a type hierarchy, ACT-UP provides the necessary macros.
For example, the following structure defines a chunk type of name <a href="ACT-UP.html#strategy">strategy</a> with four slots.
One of these slots is assigned a default value (<a href="ACT-UP.html#strategy">strategy</a>).

<P class="code">
(<span class="keyword">define-chunk-type</span> strategy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(type 'a-strategy)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dampen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;success)</p>

<P>
Note that the <a href="ACT-UP.html#type">type</a> member is not required by ACT-UP.

<P>
To define an inherited type, use this construction:

<P class="code"> (<span class="keyword">define-chunk-type</span> (lazy-strategy <span class="builtin">:include</span> strategy)<br></p>

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020030">
...define a new model?</A>
</H4>

<P>
The model is defined automatically when <a href="ACT-UP.html#act-up.lisp">act-up.lisp</a> is loaded.  To reset the model, use the <a href="ACT-UP.html#reset-model">reset-model</a> function.  To create a new model (multiple models may be used in parallel), use <a href="ACT-UP.html#make-model">make-model</a>.  Use the function <a href="ACT-UP.html#set-current-actUP-model">set-current-actUP-model</a> to define the current model.

<P>
The ACT-UP meta-process keeps track of model time that is common to all models.  You may define several meta-processes and use/reuse them as you like with the function <a href="ACT-UP.html#make-meta-process">make-meta-process</a>.  You can bind *current-actUP-meta-process* to a meta-process to switch.  Use <a href="ACT-UP.html#reset-mp">reset-mp</a> to discard and reset the current meta-process.


<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020080">
... define a procedural rule ("production")?</A>
</H4>

<P> ACT-UP does not use IF-THEN production rules as known from ACT-R.
Instead, it allows you define Lisp functions that we call
<em>procedures</em>; they represent multiple, theoretical ACT-R productions.  An important property of
ACT-UP models is that the procedures are not always tested in parallel; flow
control is achieved through standard Lisp programming.

Define procedures using <a href="ACT-UP.html#defproc">defproc</a>, similar to the way you would define a Lisp function with the `defun' macro:

<P class="code"> (<span class="keyword">defproc</span> subtract-digit (minuend subtrahend)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="string">"Perform subtraction of a single digit"</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (- minuend subtrahend))</p>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020030">
...define a chunk?</A>
</H4>

<P>
Chunks are Lisp structures that are of type `chunk', or of a type
defined with `define-chunk-type'.  They can be created with the
`make-chunk' function, or with the creator functions of the more
specific type.

<P>
When a chunk is created, a unique name should be assigned.  Otherwise,
this name is assigned automatically when the chunk is added to the DM.

<P class="code"> (<span class="keyword">make-chunk</span> <span class="builtin">:name</span> 'andrew <span class="builtin">:age</span> 42 <span class="builtin">:spouse</span> 'louise)<br>
(<span class="keyword">make-chunk</span> <span class="builtin">:name</span> 'louise <span class="builtin">:age</span> 35 <span class="builtin">:spouse</span> 'andrew)<br></p>
<br>

<P>
When assigning values to the attributes defining a chunk, symbols are
interpreted as names of other chunks in DM.  This is often more
comfortable than assigning the values directly.

<P>
Note, however, that certain actions - such as defining Sji weights
between chunks - will cause ACT-UP to implicitly define an empty chunk
of a given name in the DM, if that chunk is not found in DM.



<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020040">
...commit a chunk to memory or reinforce it?</A>
</H4>

<P>
To specify the "presentation" of a specific chunk, use the function <a href="ACT-UP.html#learn">learn</a>.
The chunk reference may be supplied in a normal variable (equivalent to ACT-R's buffer),
or the chunk may be produced right there and then using the <a href="ACT-UP.html#make-type">make-chunk</a> function, as in the following example:

<P class="code"> (<span class="keyword">learn-chunk</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class="keyword">make-chunk</span> <span class="builtin">:name</span> 'guess <span class="builtin">:success</span> 0.2))<br></p>

This will create a new strategy chunk, setting two of its parameters,
and commit it to memory.

To reinforce the existing chunk, use the chunk's name:

<P class="code">(<span class="keyword">learn-chunk</span> 'guess)</p>

Note that making a new chunk and calling `learn-chunk' will always
create a separate chunk.  It will not merge the new chunk with any
existing chunk (this would not scale very well, computationally).  You
must use the unique chunk name, or retrieve the chunk before
comitting it, or use the `make-chunk*' syntax to extract a chunk from
declarative memory for learning.  For example:

<P class="code">
(<span class="keyword">learn-chunk</span> (<span class="keyword">make-chunk</span> <span class="builtin">:success</span> 0.2))&nbsp;&nbsp; [1]<br>
(<span class="keyword">learn-chunk</span> (<span class="keyword">make-chunk*</span> <span class="builtin">:success</span> 0.2))&nbsp;&nbsp;[2]<br>
</p>

Case 1 would make a new chunk with the given success value, give it a
unique name, and add it to declarative memory.  Case 2, on the other
hand, would find the chunk that is already in declarative memory, and
boost its presentation count via base-level learning.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020050">
... retrieve an item from declarative memory?</A>
</H4>

<P>
Simply use the high-level functions <a href="ACT-UP.html#retrieve-chunk">retrieve-chunk</a>, or <a href="ACT-UP.html#blend-retrieve-chunk">blend-retrieve-chunk</a> (for blending).  The following example retrieves the most active chunk that has the name <a href="ACT-UP.html#guess">guess</a> .  The chunk contained in the variable <i>valve-open-chunk</i> spreads activation.  No partial matching is used:


<P class="code">
(<span class="keyword">retrieve-chunk</span> '(<span class="builtin">:name</span> guess))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(list valve-open-chunk) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nil)<br>
</p>

<P>
Several low-level functions are provided as well.  <a href="ACT-UP.html#filter-chunks">filter-chunks</a> produces a list of all chunks that match a given set of
criteria.  In the example below, we are looking for a chunk with the <i>name</i> attribute <a href="ACT-UP.html#guess">guess</a>.

<P>
The <a href="ACT-UP.html#best-chunk">best-chunk</a> function does the actual (time-consuming and noisy) retrieval: it selects the best chunk out of the (filtered) list of chunks, given additional retrieval cues that spread activation and, if so desired, a set of filter specifications for partial matching.  In this example, we use an existing chunk stored in the <i>valve-open-chunk</i> variable as a single retrieval cue, and no partial matching:

<P class="code">
(<span class="keyword">best-chunk</span> (<span class="keyword">filter-chunks</span> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<span class="keyword">model-chunks</span> (current-actUP-model))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '(<span class="builtin">:name</span> guess))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(list valve-open-chunk) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nil)<br></p>

<P>
When combining low-level functions, use the function <a href="ACT-UP.html#blend">blend</a> instead of <a href="ACT-UP.html#retrieve-chunk">retrieve-chunk</a>.
In addition to the cues and partial-matching specification known from <a href="ACT-UP.html#retrieve-chunk">retrieve-chunk</a>, it also expects a chunk type (such as <a href="ACT-UP.html#strategy">strategy</a>), which determines the kind of chunk created as a result of blending.

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020090">
... select a procedure (in lieu of a production rule) using subsymbolic utility learning?</A>
</H4>
<h5>Quick Answer</h5>
<P>
Define competing procedures as above and give each a <TT>:group</TT> attribute in order to group them into a competition set:

<p class="code">(<span class="keyword">defproc</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;force-over ()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="builtin">:group</span> choose-strategy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...)<br>
(<span class="keyword">defproc</span> force-under ()<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="builtin">:group</span> choose-strategy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;...)</p>

<P>
Then, invoke one of the procedures (as chosen by utility) as such:

<P>
<TT>(choose-strategy)</TT>

<P>
Arguments may be used as well (but ensure that all procedures accept the same arguments).

<P>
Utilities are learned using the function <a href="ACT-UP.html#assign-reward">assign-reward</a>:

<P>
<TT>(assign-reward 1.5)</TT>

<P>
This example distributes a reward of  across the recently invoked procedures.
Procedures do not have to have a <TT>:group</TT> attribute and they do not have to have been invoked
via the group name in order to receive a reward; however, they have to have been defined
using the <a href="ACT-UP.html#defproc">defproc</a> macro (rather than just being Lisp functions).

<P>
Configure utility learning via the parameters <a href="ACT-UP.html#*au-rpps*">*au-rpps*</a>, <a href="ACT-UP.html#*au-rfr*">*au-rfr*</a>, <a href="ACT-UP.html#*alpha*">*alpha*</a>, and <a href="ACT-UP.html#*iu*">*iu*</a>.



<h5>Worked Example</h5>
Note that ACT-UP supports utility learning and even procedure compilation.
Utility learning means that multiple procedures may compete for execution,
and that the actually executed procedures are assigned rewards if they lead
to some form of success.  To define competing procedures, they must be
grouped together in a <em>Group</em>.  A group is a set of procedures, such
as the following:

<p class="code">(<span class="keyword">defproc</span> subtract-digit-by-addition (minuend subtrahend)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="builtin">:group</span> subtract<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="string">"Perform subtraction of a single digit via addition."</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (<span class="keyword">let</span> ((chunk (<span class="keyword">retrieve-chunk</span> `(:<span class="keyword">chunk-type</span> addition-fact<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="builtin">:result</span> ,minuend<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="builtin">:add1</span> ,subtrahend))))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<span class="keyword">when</span> chunk<br>

(<span class="keyword">defproc</span> subtract-digit-by-subtraction (minuend subtrahend)<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="builtin">:result</span> ,subtrahend))))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<span class="keyword">when</span> chunk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class="keyword">learn-chunk</span> chunk)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(addition-fact-add2 chunk))))<br>
(<span class="keyword">defproc</span> subtract-digit-by-decrement (minuend subtrahend)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="builtin">:group</span> subtract<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="string">"Perform subtraction of a single digit via subtraction knowledge."</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; ...)</p>

Note that each procedure in the group takes the same, two arguments
(minuend, subtrahend).  In order to execute a subtraction, we simply
call a function that is named after the group:

<pre>(subtract 7 3)</pre>

ACT-UP will automatically choose one of procedures in the <em>subtract</em>
group.  In order to gauge the utility of each group, we must propagate
rewards to the procedures.  This can be done with the `assign-reward'
function:

<p class="code">(<span class="keyword">defproc</span> subtraction-model (a b)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class="keyword">let</span> ((result (subtract a b)))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">obtain feedback from experimental environment:<br>
</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<span class="keyword">if</span> (get-feedback a b result)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (<span class="keyword">assign-reward</span> 2.0))))<br>
<br>
<span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">environment:<br>
</span>(<span class="keyword">defun</span> <span class="function-name">get-feedback</span> (a b result)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="doc">"Environment function (experimental setup) - not part of the model.<br>
Return T if problem solved correctly."</span><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<span class="keyword">if</span> result&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">note result may be nil<br>
</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(= result (- a b))))</p>

After a short period of time, this model should learn to choose an effective, reliable strategy to
carry out a subtraction.
<p>
Rewards are assigned to ACT-UP procedures just like they would be assigned
to production procedures in ACT-R.  The most recently invoked procedure received
the largest portion of the reward; Difference-Learning governs how much of
a procedure benefits from its reward portion.

<P>
<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020030">
...model effects via production compilation?</A>
</H4>

ACT-UP may not have productions, but it does have <em>procedures</em>.
These procedures can be compiled.  To do so, we need to keep in mind that
procedure compilation will side-step any intemediate action that a model
might undertake in order to execute a procedure.  This includes retrievals
from declarative memory, but also any other side-effects such as
sensory-motor interaction, or even Lisp code.
<p>
ACT-UP's procedure compilation can be enabled by setting the
<tt>*procedure-compilation*</tt> parameter to t. 
<p>
Every time a procedure ("source procedure") is invoked, procedure compilation will create a compiled
procedure (specific to the arguments given to the procedure at invokation); its
initial utility will we <tt>*iu*</tt>.  If the source procedure is compiled a
second time, the utility of the compiled procedure will be boosted by the
utility of the source procedure according to reward assignment mechanism
(difference learning equation, as above).  The compiled procedure will,
eventually, have a higher utility than the source procedure, and it will be
executed instead.  In the subtraction example from above, the
following gives a sample of the acquired compiled procedures:
<pre>
(subtract-digit-by-subtraction 8 3) --&gt; 5
(subtract-digit-by-addition 6 2) --&gt; 4
(subtract-digit-by-addition-faulty 7 3) --&gt; nil
(subtraction-model 3 1) --&gt; 2
</pre>

<p>
Note that in order to execute the best procedure among one or more source
procedures, and all their compiled equivalents, the modeler must define a
group for the procedures and invoke them via the group name.  Reward
assignment and procedure compilation will take place no matter how the procedure
was invoked.  So, in the above example, the `subtraction-model' will
never be run in its compiled form, and rewards will always be
propagated, because it does not belong to a group and cannot be
called that way.
<P>
Again, note that in its compiled form, the procedure merely returns its
result.  No side-effects are observed.  For instance, the
`subtract-digit-by-subtraction' procedure will print the debug message
"Addition by subtraction!" every time it is run - as long as it isn't
compiled.  Once compiled, it will always just return the result. 



<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020090">
... run model code in parallel?</A>
</H4>
<P>
ACT-UP is designed assuming that most modeled processes can be
formulated as a sequence of cognitive actions.  However, in some
situations, parallelism may be necessary.
<p>
To asynchronously request the execution of some code (that is, without
waiting for the results), use the `request-' syntax, e.g., <em>request-retrieve-chunk</em>.
The <em>request-</em> functions are defined for each module-specific
ACT-UP function that can take some time, e.g., <em>best-chunk</em>,
<em>filter-chunks</em>, <em>retrieve-chunk</em> (for the declarative
memory module), and all functions defined with `defproc' (for the
procedural module).  The functions all return an execution handle.
<p>
This function kicks off task execution in
parallel; it returns without delay (in ACT-UP time).  Once the result
of the operation is needed, it may be retrieved using the
`receive' function and the previously obtained <em>handle</em>.
<div class="code">
(<span class="keyword">let</span> ((handle (<span class="keyword">request-retrieve-chunk</span> '(:chunk-type ...)))) <br>
  <span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span> <span class="comment"> do something else </span><br>
  ... <br>
  (<span class="keyword">receive</span> handle))
</div>

Different threads of execution may share resources.  We follow
Anderson et al. (2004) in that each module can only handle one request
at a time.  We follow some of Salvucci&Taatgen's (2008) <em>threaded
cognition</em> approach: threads acquire resources in a "greedy" and
"polite" manner.  When a `request-' function is called, it will wait
until the module is available, but then reserve the module regardless
of other goals that may exist.  The module functions (such as
`retrieve-chunk') will also wait for the module to be free.
Similarly, `receive' will wait.  To check if the result is available,
use the `response-available-p' function.
<p>
<h5>Example</h5>
The following example shows how a retrieval request is initiated and
finished.  Upon initiating the request, ACT-UP does not "wait" for the
retrieval to finish.

<div class="code">

<P>
ACT-UP provides a `reset-module' function to explicitly cancel a
module's operation. To wait for a module to finish processing when the
handle is not known, use `wait-for-module'.


<h5>Threads</h5>

ACT-UP's does not provide an API to `threads' as in <em>threaded cognition</em>.  However, <a
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CommonLispThreads">Lisp Threads</a> might
be useful.  Appropriate interference will be the result.
<P>
<em>Note that parallelism has seen limited testing in ACT-UP so far.
Your feedback is appreciated!</em>
