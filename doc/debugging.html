<h1>Debugging cognitive models in ACT-UP</h1>

<p>

ACT-UP comes with a range of functions designed to make debugging
easy.
<p>
To boot, you can use the debugging mechanisms of your Lisp compiler.
This may include very useful function to step through your model
procedures and inspect variables.
<p>
ACT-UP provides functions to inspect the symbolic and subsymbolic
properties of chunks and procedures (1), macros and functions to
enable logging and selective logging of what happens during the
execution of the model (2).



<h2>1. Inspecting a model</h2>

<h3>Declarative memory</h3>
Often, subsymbolic activation and the symbolic contents of chunks
during model execution give valuable cues to the problems with a
model.
<p>
To print a list of the chunks in the current model, write

<pre>(<span class="keyword">show-chunks</span> '(:<span class="keyword">chunk-type</span> person)</pre>

This will print all chunks of type `person'.  Of course, you may use
any other slot-value combinations to reduce the number of chunks
output (see `retrieve-chunk' for further examples).
<p>
A single chunk may be printed with the `pc' and `pc*' functions.  You
may sometimes want to combine it with an expression to identify a
specific chunk:

<pre>(<span class="keyword">pc</span>* 'john-13)
(<span class="keyword">pc</span>* (<span
class="keyword">best-chunk</span> (<span
class="keyword">model-chunks</span>)))

</pre>


The first expression will print the chunk named `john-13', while the
second one will identify the chunk with the highest (base-level)
activation (plus noise) in the current model and print it.
<p>
Activation calculation is sometimes complicated.  The following
expressions will describe the activation of a chunk in terms of its
base-level activation, partial matching, spreading activation and
noise terms:

<pre>(<span class="keyword">explain-activation</span> 'john-13)<br>
(<span class="keyword">explain-activation</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (<span class="keyword">best-chunk</span> (<span class="keyword">filter-chunks</span> (<span class="keyword">model-chunks</span>)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(<span
class="builtin">:location</span> park)))
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'(lawyer park))<br></pre>

The first expression will explain the activation of a chunk named
`john-13', while the second one will identify all of the chunks in the
current model with a `location' slot set to `park', select the one
with the highest activation, and print its activation.  The activation
includes spreading activation from two sources: the chunks `lawyer',
and `park'.
<p>

<h3>Procedural memory</h3>

Use the `show-utilities' function to print a list of all procedures
(manually defined and compiled) and their respective utilities:
<pre>(show-utilities)</pre>

<h3>Models</h3>

<p>
To print a list of architectural parameters, use this expression:

<pre>(show-parameters)</pre>

<p>
When working with multiple models in parallel, it may be useful to
give them meaningful names when creating them:

<pre>(<span class="keyword">make-model</span> <span class="builtin">:name</span> 'player-A)</pre>

The function `set-current-model' will permanently switch the current
model to a different one.


<h2>2. Logging</h2>


<h3>Log output for all or part of your model</h3>
<tt>(debug-detail &body body)</tt> is the most important macro for
logging.
It executes all the forms in BODY, while printing detailed information
about the goings-on inside the cognitive architecture.
<p>
You may use this macro when calling your model, such as

<pre>(<span class="keyword">debug-detail</span> (run-experiment))<br></pre>
or also inside the model in particularly interesting situations:

<tt>(debug-detail (retrieve-chunk '(:chunk-type person)))</tt>


<h3>Logging: warnings only</h3>
<p>
In order to to enable general logging of important messages, you can
set the <tt>*debug*</tt> variable:

<pre>(setq <span class="keyword">*debug*</span> *warning*)<br></pre>

Possible values for this option are <tt>*critical*, *warning*,
*informational*, *all*</tt>.


<h3>Selective logging</h3>
<p>
ACT-UP allows you to keep a log without printing all of it.  This can
be a time-saver.
<p>
You may use `debug-grep' to extract only those messages with
certain content:

<pre>(<span class="keyword">debug-grep</span> <span class="string">"retrieval"</span>)<br>
(<span class="keyword">debug-grep</span> <span class="string">"person"</span>)</pre>
<p>
As you can see, you may select for any text in the output, for
example in order to watch specfic chunks or procedures.

<p>Sometimes it is useful to inspect the log output only in cases when
the model fails what it is supposed to do.  For example, the model may
fail to execute an experimental task only in one out of 1000 cases.
In such situations, you may have ACT-UP keep its log output for each
model run, but not print it:
<p>
Execute your model or parts thereof with an expression like
<pre>(<span class="keyword">debug-detail*</span> (run-experiment)</pre>

This will save the log
output into an internal buffer.
<p>
Once you decide to print the log output, evaluate
<pre>(debug-log)</pre>
If you'd like to discard the previous log output (and you should do
that), evaluate <pre>(debug-clear)</pre>
